This training program will take you through some of the core parts of what the programming team does, starting with Github and ending with a working swerve project that you can drive in the simulator. It is designed to be a tutorial that you can follow along with, starting from a template project that has most things already set up. At the end, there are 3 challenges that you can try to figure out on your own. I included links to screenshots of solutions, but try to figure these out on your own first and only look at the solutions if you’re stuck.

Watch these 2 videos before attempting this tutorial. It should be manageable to understand for someone who has some programming experience and kind of understands how an FRC robot works. These videos will make it a lot clearer though hopefully:

1. [Command Based Robot Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoxeXqy1bdQ)
2. [How Swerve Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xi9yb1IMyA) (you won’t ever need to actually write most of this code cause its a lot of hard math and a library called YAGSL does it all for you, but it's helpful to kind of understand)
